## 20 Social Posts (X / LinkedIn / Instagram / TikTok adaptable)

> Tip: Use each post as-is for X and LinkedIn, then convert to IG/TikTok caption + short on-screen hook.

### 1) Launch Day
**Hook:** We’re live.

Most people don’t need “more AI.”
They need one agent that actually saves time this week.

That’s why we built **Launch My Agent**.

✅ Fast setup  
✅ Real workflows  
✅ Human-approved automation

If your team repeats the same admin tasks every day, this is for you.

### 2) Problem/Solution
You’re not behind on AI because of tools.  
You’re behind because implementation is messy.

**Launch My Agent** turns ideas into working agents in days, not quarters.

Start with one bottleneck. Automate it. Measure. Scale.

### 3) Anti-Hype Post
Hot take: Most AI projects fail before they start because goals are vague.

At Launch My Agent, we start with one question:
**“What outcome do you want in 14 days?”**

No fluff. Just execution.

### 4) Founder Pain
If you’re still:
- manually following up leads
- copy/pasting across tools
- answering the same internal questions

You don’t need another dashboard.
You need an agent system.

That’s what we launch.

### 5) Before/After
**Before:** “We’re exploring AI.”  
**After:** “Our agent handles intake + follow-up and saves us 7 hours/week.”

That transition is the whole business model.

### 6) Speed Theme
Your competitor isn’t smarter. They’re faster at shipping.

Launch My Agent helps you ship AI agents quickly, safely, and with clear business use-cases.

Velocity > perfection.

### 7) Simplicity Theme
Complicated AI stacks look impressive.
Simple automations make money.

Our rule:
1. Identify repetitive work
2. Build agent workflow
3. Keep human checkpoints
4. Improve weekly

### 8) Credibility Theme
A useful AI agent should do at least one of these:
- increase response speed
- reduce errors
- free owner/operator time
- improve lead conversion

If it does none of these, it’s a demo—not a solution.

### 9) “Not Replacing Humans” Theme
AI agents shouldn’t replace your team.
They should remove repetitive work so your team can focus on clients, strategy, and growth.

That’s the Launch My Agent approach.

### 10) Decision-Maker Post
If you run an SMB and your team is busy but bottlenecked, this is your sign.

One well-designed agent can remove operational drag immediately.

Start small. Win fast. Expand.

### 11) Build in Public
Building Launch My Agent in public:
- Week 1: workflow mapping
- Week 2: pilot deployment
- Week 3: optimization loop

No “AI transformation” theater. Just practical rollout.

### 12) Objection Handling
“We tried AI and it didn’t stick.”

Totally fair.
Most teams start with tools before process.

We reverse it:
- map process first
- add agent where repetition exists
- validate with real usage

### 13) Content-to-Consulting Bridge
If your content team is stretched, your sales follow-up is inconsistent, or ops feels chaotic—
that’s exactly where agents help first.

You don’t need 10 agents.
You need the right first one.

### 14) Lead Magnet Style Post
Want a quick audit?
Comment **AGENT** and we’ll send the 3-step framework we use to pick the highest-ROI first workflow.

Simple, practical, no jargon.

### 15) Team Enablement
The best AI rollout plan is boring:
- clear SOPs
- clear handoffs
- clear approvals

That’s good news.
Boring systems scale.

### 16) Contrast Post
Most AI conversations are about models.
Our conversations are about **margin, speed, and service quality**.

Tech matters.
Business outcomes matter more.

### 17) Social Proof Prompt
Curious: what’s one task in your business you’d happily never do again?

That answer is usually your first agent opportunity.

### 18) Time ROI Post
If an agent saves 45 minutes/day for one key role,
that’s ~15 hours/month from one workflow.

Now apply that across 2–3 workflows.

That’s the compounding effect we build for.

### 19) “Done With You” Offer Post
Launch My Agent is built for teams that want speed **with guardrails**.

You get:
- implementation support
- clear checkpoints
- practical automations you can actually operate

### 20) Direct Offer Post
Need help launching your first business-ready AI agent?

We’ll help you:
1) pick the right workflow  
2) deploy fast  
3) optimize with real data

## 10 Comment-Reply Templates (Witty + Safe)

### 1) “AI is overhyped.”
Fair point—hype is loud. We focus on boring wins: fewer repetitive tasks, faster execution, better follow-up.

### 2) “Will this replace jobs?”
Our goal is to replace repetitive clicks, not people. Teams still own decisions; agents handle the grind.

### 3) “Sounds expensive.”
Totally valid question. Most clients start with one workflow so ROI is visible before scaling.

### 4) “We tried this before and failed.”
You’re not alone. Usually the issue is starting with tools before process. We start with the process first.

### 5) “Can this work for my industry?”
Great question. If your team repeats tasks, there’s usually an agent opportunity—industry just changes the workflow details.

### 6) “How long does setup take?”
Short answer: faster than most expect when scope is focused. We start with one high-impact workflow.

### 7) “Do I need technical skills?”
No engineering degree required. If you can explain your process, we can usually help you automate it.

### 8) “Is my data safe?”
Important question. We design with access controls, approval checkpoints, and practical guardrails from day one.

### 9) “This feels too good to be true.”
Healthy skepticism = smart operator behavior. Best move is pilot one workflow and judge results, not promises.

### 10) “What should I automate first?”
Anything repetitive, rules-based, and time-consuming is a strong candidate. If you want, we can help shortlist in 10 minutes.

## Rapid Repurposing Notes (Optional)
- **X:** keep under ~280 chars by trimming bullet lines.
- **LinkedIn:** keep full format + line breaks.
- **Instagram:** use first line as hook; add carousel with 3 bullets.
- **TikTok:** use hook as on-screen text; caption = post body + CTA.
- Rotate CTAs every 3–4 posts to avoid repetition.
