# Agentic AI Advances Brief (Working Draft for Product Strategy)
Last updated: 2026-02-27

## What is moving fast right now
1. **Tool-using agents with tighter loops**
   - Agents are improving at planning -> acting -> verifying -> retrying.
   - Reliable workflows now depend more on guardrails + retries than raw model quality.

2. **Multi-agent orchestration in practical stacks**
   - Specialist roles (researcher, operator, reviewer) are outperforming single-agent prompts.
   - Human-approved handoffs remain essential for high-risk actions.

3. **Memory systems are becoming product-critical**
   - Long-term memory and session memory improve consistency and personalization.
   - Memory hygiene (compaction, indexing, stale-data prevention) is now a differentiator.

4. **Security-first agent design is non-negotiable**
   - Trusted vs untrusted input boundaries are becoming standard architecture.
   - Secret scoping, restricted keys, and audit logs are now baseline requirements.

5. **Verticalized agent products beat generic prompts**
   - Buyers respond better to role-specific packs (solo founder ops, creator workflows, support automations) than broad AI bundles.

## Implications for Launch My Agent
- Sell practical systems, not vague AI advice.
- Emphasize secure setup + outcome templates.
- Keep beginner path short: one workflow, one win, one upgrade path.

## Product opportunities from these trends
- "Agent Safety Kit" (policy + key-scoping + response playbooks)
- "Solo Operator Bot Stack" (daily briefing, inbox triage, follow-up)
- "Build-in-Public Agent" (content idea -> script -> post pipeline)
- "Client Onboarding Agent" (intake + document checklist + follow-up)
